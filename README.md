## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to integrate and use RESTful APIs to perform basic customer management tasks. It consists of a basic web application with three screens: a login screen, a customer list screen, and a screen to add a new customer.

## Features
The key features of this project include:

* `Authentication`: Users can authenticate using their credentials, and the application will retrieve a bearer token from the authentication API. This token is then used for subsequent API calls.

* `View Customer List`: Users can view a list of customers fetched from the API.

* `Create New Customer`: Users can add new customers by providing necessary details.

* `Delete Customer`: Users can delete existing customers by selecting a customer from the list.

* `Update Customer`: Users can update customer information by selecting a customer from the list and providing updated details.
## Usage
To use this web application for customer management, follow these steps:
1) Clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/soumitra2001/Customer_Management_System.git

```
2) Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

3) Open the project in a web browser by opening the index.html file.

4) You will be presented with the login screen. Use your credentials to log in. Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the customer table.

5) You will then be redirected to the customer list screen, where you can view a list of customers, create new customers, delete existing customers, and update customer information.

6) Enjoy using the Customer Management application!

## Screens
